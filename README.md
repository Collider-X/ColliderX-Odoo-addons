# ColliderX-Odoo-addons
This repository contains Odoo modules that builds the infrastructure of ColliderX.

## cx_website
A module containing assets for the ColliderX website. It is possible to manage versioning from GitHub (a plus), but the code snippets don't seem to work anymore (in edit mode). That defeats the purpose of providing a simpler interface for non-coders. Not recommended.
