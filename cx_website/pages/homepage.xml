                  <h3>About ColliderX</h3>
                  <p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1512352115284_270" style="word-wrap: break-word; color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.7); font-family: &quot;Titillium Web&quot;; font-size: 18px;">ColliderX is the world’s first open-source,&amp;nbsp;crowdsourced, and crowdfunded blockchain research and development hub. This is a unique model for unbiased, ground-breaking R&amp;amp;D that bridges the gap between industry problems and pure academic or corporate research.</p>
                  <p style="word-wrap: break-word; color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.7); font-family: &quot;Titillium Web&quot;; font-size: 18px;">Although we are passionate about the power of blockchain technology, we don’t want to be restricted to just that; we explore blockchain at the convergence of other technologies. To us, "[Blockchain++]" means blockchain at the intersection of machine learning and A.I, with augmented reality, and Internet of Things as other areas of interest.</p>
                  <p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1512352115284_274" style="word-wrap: break-word; margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.7); font-family: &quot;Titillium Web&quot;; font-size: 18px;">The ColliderX name was inspired by the world's most powerful particle accelerator, a facility to allow physicists to test the predictions of different theories, by accelerating particles to a point where the kinetic energy created can impact other particles. Similarly, we are putting incredibly smart people together in a room (virtual and physical) to see how we can harness the power of experimental research and tinkering.&amp;nbsp;</p>
